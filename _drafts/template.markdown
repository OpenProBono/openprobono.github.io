We are hard at work building and evaluating our general legal search AI, getting it ready to be released to the public here at OpenProBono. However, we found that one of the ‘tools’ we built for our AI to interact with the [Courtlistener API](https://www.courtlistener.com) could be useful even on its own. As a result, we decided to release this tool immedietly.

Introducing our [OpinionNavigator](https://opinion-search.openprobono.com), a powerful resource for legal professionals and researchers. This tool efficiently searches for case opinions, summarizes them, and embeds new opinions into a vector database. When you submit a query, it searches its database to provide relevant opinions and specific matching sections of the text. The tool also supports keyword searches, allowing you to find snippets containing exact words or phrases, along with date and jurisdiction filters.

For those interested in the technical aspects, we’ve made the full product code available on GitHub, along with our progress on the comprehensive legal AI. We encourage anyone to reproduce or improve upon our work and stay tuned for more technical blog posts in the future.

We are not the only ones to do this! The tools [descrybe.ai](https://descrybe.ai) and [olaw](https://github.com/harvard-lil/olaw) both also allow you to easily search the Courtlistener API using AI, and you should check both of them out too!

Lastly, if you are interested in keeping up with us and being one of the first to try out our full-fledged legal search AI, fill out [this interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-UGGwGnY2u4Sr3WizWI6nzHEk1ezVs3wDJStRVVA8H6GQsg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
