Over 80% of Americans can’t afford legal help, and over 120 million legal problems aren’t resolved fairly every year. Lack of legal knowledge disproportionately affects marginalized communities and perpetuates injustice. Accessing legal knowledge is traditionally time-consuming, complex, and expensive. We aim to provide legal information in a faster, easier, and more affordable way. We offer a web and mobile platform where users can ask questions, verify information, and discover resources. By linking all information to primary sources, not displaying ads, and taking a personalized and holistic approach, we can ensure users understand their rights and protect their interests.
