Over 80% of Americans can’t afford legal help, and over 120 million legal problems aren’t resolved fairly every year. Lack of legal knowledge disproportionately affects marginalized communities and perpetuates injustice. Accessing legal knowledge is traditionally time-consuming, complex, and expensive. We aim to provide legal information in a faster, easier, and more affordable way. We offer a web and mobile platform where users can ask questions, verify information, and discover resources. By linking all information to primary sources, not displaying ads, and taking a personalized and holistic approach, we can ensure users understand their rights and protect their interests.

###About the Founders

Arman Aydemir: Arman started thinking about applying NLP to the legal domain over 5 years ago when studying ML at CU Boulder. He published research and started a PhD after graduating to continue studying this topic. Unsatisfied with the lack of practical applicability of his research, he left the program and entered the workforce for a year before deciding to pursue building a legal NLP company full-time. He has the technical ability, knowledge of the landscape, vision, and will to make this company succeed.

Nick Colvin: Nick has a Bachelors in CS from UNC and a Masters from UTD. His interest in ML began in undergrad and led him to work for a machine vision startup. Two years later he entered graduate school to work more closely with ML. He started to work part-time on OpenProBono during his last semester, and has since joined full time. He knows which tools are best to develop and deploy our AI, and keeps up with the latest technologies we can use from other domains.
